# maxSubArray
A Java program that implements the divide-and-conquer algorithm for the Maximum SubArray problem. This program consists of a single Java class named MaxSubarray.java, and is compilable with the simple command "javac MaxSubarray.java". this program takes two command-line arguments: an input file and an output file. The first line of the input file is an integer N, which represents the number of problem instances contained in the file. It is then followed by the N instance specifications. The first line of the specification of each instance will is an integer M, that represents the size of the array in that instance. It is followed by M lines, each containing an element of the array. For example, the following is a file that contains two problem instances consisting of the two arrays (6,-1,4) and (1,-1,0,2):
